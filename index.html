    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To-Do List is a self-explanatory project; it is a website that allows the user to create a to-do list. It is a full-stack project that
    utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the back-end, the app uses Node, Express, and Sqlite3. The user has access to the to-do list upon
    completing the simple login process, and from there they are able to add and delete tasks made up of text. The server loads different tasks
    depending on the user that is logged in and the tasks they have saved.</p>
